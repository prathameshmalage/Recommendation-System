    "1)\t<u> Original question </u>: Given a playlist name and the initial few songs added to the playlist by the creator, can our system recommend the next set of songs which the user might add to their playlist? <br>\n",
    "<u> Updated question </u>:  Instead of the playlist name, given the initial few songs can our system recommend the next set of songs which can be added to a playlist?\n",
    "2)\t<u> Original question </u>: If there is one song added to multiple playlists, can we understand how people perceive the same song differently? <br>\n",
    "<u> Updated question </u>: If one song is included in multiple playlists, gauge the category/general mood of the playlists from the attributes of other songs in the playlist (danceability, valence, tempo, etc). From this, can we infer the category of playlist the song is most likely to fall in? <br>\n",
    "3)\tCan we include this perception to make our recommendation system more robust? <br>\n",
    "i)\tYes, we can see which playlist category the song is most suited to and tailor our recommendation based on that <br>\n",
    "b)\t<u> Question removed </u>: <s> Can we infer the playlist’s purpose based on the genre and metrics of songs in the playlist? <br> </s>\n",
    "4)\tIs there a correlation between the number of songs in a playlist and the number of followers that the playlist has i.e., the popularity? <br>\n",
    "5)\t<u> Question removed:  </u> <s> Based on the most popular artists within a specific time period, can we gauge what kind of impact they have had on society? </s> <br>\n",
    "6)\t<u> Question removed:  </u> <s> Is there any metric which is similar between all the songs added to a playlist which has subconsciously influenced the creator to add those songs? </s> <br>\n",
    "7)\t<u> New question:  </u>Can we predict if a new song is going to be a hit or a flop by analysing the correlation between the attributes of the song and the song popularity score?"

    "- As noted in the proposal, we are primarily using a subset of the dataset from the 'Million Playlist Dataset Challenge' and pairing that with the song attributes data obtained via Spotify API calls\n",
    "- Due to the size of the Million Playlist Data and the time it would take to process it, we chose to work with the initial 55 playlists and the songs within them for the purpose of data processing\n",
    "- So far, we have gathered all the data needed in one dataset and made it ready to use for training the model. We plan to achieve this milestone by 11/15/2021 so that we are on track to complete the rest of the tasks by the original schedule"
